<!-- I want the themes to be focused on developing Mucci Men/Mucci Metaverse as a digital martial arts community OR focusing on developing the tools or recruiting the right people for developing it

I could lowkey write fiction for a story about a digital martial arts video game. Involving New France culture, masquerades, etc etc
I need a more well defined vision for the digital martial arts things itself ig. "Smash but 3D" isn't cutting it
I'd also want my design for HDR Falcon/improved Ult Falcon/Phoenix Falcon/Sean Falcon to be enacted. Would be forking Ult Falcon enough to distinguish it from normal Ult Falcon prob but would be an undertaking of a project
(falcon buffs: -forward momentum kept when jumping like in Melee -Usmash being safe on close hit -Either more evasion or movement speed -UpB to send more horizontal -Something to beat air camping near top blastzone. Could be something like Joker's guns facing upwards or Uair sending more horizontally -An actually useful NeutralB/Fsmash -Fixed Dashback. I want Falcon to e all about movement, speed, and tight handling like F-Zero GX. Reactions too ig and constant fast pressure, like crazy combos. Focus on acrobatics and athleticism that has counterplay to counterplay)
I'd want to maybe keep working on my ultramarathon skills. And I'd want VR stuff so I can work on developing stuff for them but idk the skill/knowledge prereqs for such things


It's just so easy to sublimate all of my ambitions into fiction writing, and I don't know how much of that is something I'd actually wanna do instead of trying to realize it IRL
Also, I need to be very specific and actionable in my list. It's very easy for VR IRL and fiction to blur together, so I need to do some lawyering with not letting myself create those loopholes
I think I'd also need a hallucination clause/rule so that I can't just take a word and change the meaning. Example, it should be something like "if I take 100 people IRL and ask them to imagine/define the 100 words, assuming the had the correct resources for it, would they reach similar conclusions?" A challenge to make something plain without making it lose meaning
Generating a list is pretty hard in itself though. I just need to create a rough draft of maybe even 500 things to consider
no weasel word

Step 1. Generate list of 500 things
Step 2. Cull to 300
Step 3. Fine tune the vision for the 300 things, and include deliverables for realizing the goal and the legal parts so I can't use loopholes/oversights (ChatGPT prompt: You are the Life Coaching Lawyer, a guy who specializes in deconstructing goals people have made and finding ways to break the targets while showing how poorly constructed the goals really are. Here's your latest case to crack: *insert goal here*)
Step 4: Balance the items and add things that were cut to make list harder

If there are some things that are too easy to hit (e.g. reinstalling pirated FL Studio) then just group them into a Maintenance category/item or sum


Also include on list that items have to be in good working condition like if I listed it on Ebay
Also I would like good craftsmanship to be a virtue/point of consideration on the list

Rule: Once the list is made, I can further specify an item on the list, but not unspecify

Upon reviewing the list, it should be such that achieving any 30 of the items on the list requires an intense amount of effort and results in me having a decent or high social standing (even if I don't have a high SES)
